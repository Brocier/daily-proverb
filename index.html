    Proverbs 16
    <!-- <div id=monthDay></div> -->
  </h2>

  <div>
    <br/> To humans belong the plans of the heart,
    <br/> but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue.
    <br/> All a person’s ways seem pure to them,
    <br/> but motives are weighed by the Lord.
    <br/> Commit to the Lord whatever you do,
    <br/> and he will establish your plans.
    <br/> The Lord works out everything to its proper end—
    <br/> even the wicked for a day of disaster.
    <br/> The Lord detests all the proud of heart.
    <br/> Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.
    <br/> Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for;
    <br/> through the fear of the Lord evil is avoided.
    <br/> When the Lord takes pleasure in anyone’s way,
    <br/> he causes their enemies to make peace with them.
    <br/> Better a little with righteousness
    <br/> than much gain with injustice.
    <br/> In their hearts humans plan their course,
    <br/> but the Lord establishes their steps.
    <br/> The lips of a king speak as an oracle,
    <br/> and his mouth does not betray justice.
    <br/> Honest scales and balances belong to the Lord;
    <br/> all the weights in the bag are of his making.
    <br/> Kings detest wrongdoing,
    <br/> for a throne is established through righteousness.
    <br/> Kings take pleasure in honest lips;
    <br/> they value the one who speaks what is right.
    <br/> A king’s wrath is a messenger of death,
    <br/> but the wise will appease it.
    <br/> When a king’s face brightens, it means life;
    <br/> his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.
    <br/> How much better to get wisdom than gold,
    <br/> to get insight rather than silver!
    <br/> The highway of the upright avoids evil;
    <br/> those who guard their ways preserve their lives.
    <br/> Pride goes before destruction,
    <br/> a haughty spirit before a fall.
    <br/> Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed
    <br/> than to share plunder with the proud.
    <br/> Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers,
    <br/> and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.
    <br/> The wise in heart are called discerning,
    <br/> and gracious words promote instruction.
    <br/> Prudence is a fountain of life to the prudent,
    <br/> but folly brings punishment to fools.
    <br/> The hearts of the wise make their mouths prudent,
    <br/> and their lips promote instruction.
    <br/> Gracious words are a honeycomb,
    <br/> sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.
    <br/> There is a way that appears to be right,
    <br/> but in the end it leads to death.
    <br/> The appetite of laborers works for them;
    <br/> their hunger drives them on.
    <br/> A scoundrel plots evil,
    <br/> and on their lips it is like a scorching fire.
    <br/> A perverse person stirs up conflict,
    <br/> and a gossip separates close friends.
    <br/> A violent person entices their neighbor
    <br/> and leads them down a path that is not good.
    <br/> Whoever winks with their eye is plotting perversity;
    <br/> whoever purses their lips is bent on evil.
    <br/> Gray hair is a crown of splendor;
    <br/> it is attained in the way of righteousness.
    <br/> Better a patient person than a warrior,
    <br/> one with self-control than one who takes a city.
    <br/> The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.
